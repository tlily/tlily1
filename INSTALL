Installation of TigerLily:

1.  Edit the top of Build.PL and set the install paths you want
    Defaults are :  install tlily in /usr/local/bin,
     install the internal modules in /usr/local/lib/tlily/LC, and
    install the global extensions in /usr/local/lib/tlily/extensions

2.  perl Build.PL install

You're Done!

For hacking within the source directory:

1.  Edit the top of Build.PL, commenting out the first block and
    uncommenting the bottom block, as indicated in the comments.

2.  perl Build.PL
    this generates a tlily that can be run using the extensions
    and libraries in the current directory.

3.  Make all changes to tlily.PL, not tlily.  perl Build.PL will
    regenerate tlily from tlily.PL
