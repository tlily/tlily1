Installation of TigerLily:

1.  perl Build.PL install
	You will be asked what directories to install into.

You're Done!

For hacking within the source directory:

1.  perl Build.PL
	Use an installation prefix of 'Current', as indicated in the
	info message.  This generates a tlily that can be run using
	the extensions and libraries in the current directory.

3.  Make all changes to tlily.PL, not tlily.  perl Build.PL will
    regenerate tlily from tlily.PL.  tlily is made read-only to
	discourage you from editing it.
