TigerLily
=========

Installing
----------
TigerLily requires Perl 5 with the Curses module.  Color support requires
a version of curses which supports color; I recommend ncurses.  Please
note that curses color handling is atrocious at best, and unspeakable at
worst -- any color problems you experience are probably the fault of
your curses.


CVS access
----------
The TigerLily sources are stored in a CVS repository.  Anyone working on
TigerLily development can get access by contacting Damien (neild@acm.rpi.edu).
The repository is currently located on zorg.hitchhiker.org.

To access the repository remotely, you will need to set two environment
variables:
  export CVSROOT=:ext:neild@zorg.hitchhiker.org:/usr/src/cvs
  export CVS_RSH=ssh

Obviously, replace the `neild' with your own userid on zorg.  CVS_RSH need
not necessarily be ssh, but this is likely to be the simplest method to use.

The important CVS commands are:
  - cvs checkout tlily
    This will grab a copy of the current source tree, and place it in a
    new directory named `tlily'.  No locking is implied by this operation;
    you may delete the checked out tree without ill effect.

All other CVS commands accept a list of files as an argument; in the absence
of this list, they operate on the current directory.

  - cvs update
    Compares a checked out tree to the current sources.

  - cvs new
    Registers a new file into the repository.

  - cvs delete
    Removes a file from the repository.

  - cvs update
    Checks in all changes in the current tree.

Read the CVS manpages for more detailed information.
