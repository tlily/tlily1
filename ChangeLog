    for the %eval command.  [DPN]

Version 0.5b
  * [LC/State.pm, LC/StatusLine.pm] Synchronization state appears on status
    line.  [DPN]
  * [LC/parse.pm] Fixed a parser bug involving < or \ in blurbs.  [DPN]

    it should have been in the command line parser [CWS]
  * [tlily.PL] the ?: construct to choose the mono/color choice hash
    didn't work right -- yanked it out to a full if() stmt [CWS]

Version 0.5a
  * [Build.PL] Bugfix:  The perl library 'use lib (...' line shouldn't have
    the trailing "/LC" on it [CWS]
  * Mention 'perl Build.PL -h' in the README [CWS]
  * [LC/Config.pm] The @load and @slash lists weren't being evaluated
    correctly for "-" entries [CWS]

    cursor wasn't repositioned properly. [CWS]
  * [Build.PL] Instead of asking for separate dirs for the extensions and
    library(LC), ask for 1 library dir that will contain the extensions,
    library, and global config file, and one that will hold the site
    config file.  [CWS]
  * [extensions/zone.pl] If $zonetype is set to 12, timestamps will be
    displayed in a 12 hour clock. [CWS]
  * [LC/StatusLine.pm] If $clocktype is set to 12, the statusline clock will
    be displayed in a 12 hour clock. [CWS]
  * [LC/StatusLine.pm] If $clockdelta is set, the statusline clock will be
    zonedelta-ed similar to what the zone module does for timestamps. [CWS]
  * Autologin.  [DPN]
  * Send collapsing.  [DPN]
  * Trap SIGWINCH, and try to do something appropriate.  [DPN]

  * Complete rewrite of the text window code.  It should now be significantly
    faster.  [DPN]
  * Extensions to load may now be specified by either a filename, or just
    an extension name.  If just an extension name is used, then the
    extension search path will be used.  [DPN]
  * Changed page up/down to M-v/C-v. [DPN]
  * Meta keys now function.  [DPN]
  * [extensions/look.pl] Removed debugging 'foo' printf. [CWS]

  * [extensions/startup.pl] New extension; snarfs ~/.lily/tlily/Startup
    on a connected event. [CWS]
  * [tlily.PL] Played with login stuff so client options are sent at the
    blurb prompt and, therefore, we get the %connected option at RPI. [CWS]
  * [LC/Event.pm] Fixed documentation;  dispatch_event takes 1 arg, a
    hashref. [CWS]
  * [extensions/look.pl] Look extension: perform a look(1) on the word under
    the cursor.  [DPN]
  * [LC/StatusLine.pm] Added a clock.  [DPN]

    when /oops-ing or /also-ing; enabled with $config{oops} and $config{also};
    when set to "/", intercepts /oops and /also, when set to "%", adds
    commands %oops and %also, when set to "/%" or "%/", does both. [CWS]
  * [tlily.PL] Commented out some unused variables and fixed some typos to
    make perl -w happier. [CWS]
  * The parser should now catch sends from the user.  (<< and <-)  [DPN]
  * Parser bug fix: *** (10:00) User has attached *** was parsed incorrectly
    if the date was in there.  [DPN]
  * [tlily.PL] Fixed bug which caused ~/.lily/tlily/init not to be read. [CWS]
  * [Build.PL] Tells you how to install when you only make tlily and

  * Minor UI bugfix involving the input line's attributes.  [DPN]
  * The Build script will now cache whether the directories in the cache
    file are for the local directory, and warn you not to do an install. [CWS]
  * If you try to install while your cached directories are for the local
    directory, the Build script asks you if you really want to install. [CWS]
  * The Build script explains better about the module library directory
    (that you shouldn't add the trailing /LC) when asking for it. [CWS]

Version 0.3a
  * Build script now asks what paths you want to use and caches them,
    rather than making you edit Build.PL to set them.
  * Build script makes all generated files read-only to discourage editing.
  * perl Build.PL release now works.
  * Sendgroup expansion (=) now works.

Version 0.2b
  * Redesigned the event model.
  * Began documenting; Event.pm and State.pm have manpages.

  * Network input routines are rewritten. 
  * A truly obscure bug involving printing the sequence '\<' is now fixed. 
  * Gagging is implemented: %gag <user> 
  * Perl code now requires %eval <code>, instead of just %code. 


Version 0.1d
  * password no longer echos. 
  * user-entered text now has an attribute 
  * timezone rewriting added 


Version 0.1c
  * Silly me. I made a foolish error when merging Josh's info patch. Fixed. 
  * /info set now works for discussions. Really. 


Version 0.1b
  * /info set now works for discussions. 
  * Private messages to multiple destinations are parsed correctly. 
  * C-d deletes the character following the cursor. 
  * Turning your blurb off is noticed. 
  * C-w deletes the word preceding the cursor. 
  * The status line is drawn in reverse when in mono mode. 
  * C-u now repositions the cursor properly. 
  * Internal handling of control characters is cleaner. 
  * Backslashes are no longer invisible.
