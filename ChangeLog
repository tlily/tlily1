Version 0.2d

    rather than making you edit Build.PL to set them.
  * Build script makes all generated files read-only to discourage editing.

  * Extensions may be loaded and unloaded during a lily session.

  * Groups are supported (the expander knows about them).
  * -- MORE -- works.
  * The password does not appear in the command history.
  * Command handlers' arguments' no longer have trailing whitespace.  (As of
    0.2c, they were receiving a terminating \n, which made just about every
