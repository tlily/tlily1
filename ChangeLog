Version 0.3c
  * Bugfix: The handler registering functions were not returning the correct
    ID to extensions.  [DPN]
  * Added prompt handing on the input line.  [DPN]
  * Complete rewrite of the text window code.  It should now be significantly
    faster.  [DPN]
  * Extensions to load may now be specified by either a filename, or just
    an extension name.  If just an extension name is used, then the
    extension search path will be used.  [DPN]
  * Changed page up/down to M-v/C-v. [DPN]
  * Meta keys now function.  [DPN]
  * [extensions/look.pl] Removed debugging 'foo' printf. [CWS]
  * [Build.PL] Added -c option to use current directories. [CWS]
  * [extensions/startup.pl] New extension; snarfs ~/.lily/tlily/Startup
    on a connected event. [CWS]
  * [tlily.PL] Played with login stuff so client options are sent at the
    blurb prompt and, therefore, we get the %connected option at RPI. [CWS]
  * [LC/Event.pm] Fixed documentation;  dispatch_event takes 1 arg, a
    hashref. [CWS]
  * [extensions/look.pl] Look extension: perform a look(1) on the word under
    the cursor.  [DPN]
  * [LC/StatusLine.pm] Added a clock.  [DPN]
  * [LC/Event.pm, LC/Extend.pm] Added support for I/O and timed events.  [DPN]
  * [extensions/expand.pl] added code to reset the sendlist more appropriately
    when /oops-ing or /also-ing; enabled with $config{oops} and $config{also};
    when set to "/", intercepts /oops and /also, when set to "%", adds
    commands %oops and %also, when set to "/%" or "%/", does both. [CWS]
  * [tlily.PL] Commented out some unused variables and fixed some typos to
    make perl -w happier. [CWS]
  * The parser should now catch sends from the user.  (<< and <-)  [DPN]
  * Parser bug fix: *** (10:00) User has attached *** was parsed incorrectly
    if the date was in there.  [DPN]
  * [tlily.PL] Fixed bug which caused ~/.lily/tlily/init not to be read. [CWS]
  * [Build.PL] Tells you how to install when you only make tlily and
    your directories aren't the current dir. [CWS]
  * [Build.PL] Now accepts 'tlily' as a target on the command line. [CWS]
  * [Build.PL] Tilde(~) expansion will be done on all paths entered by the
    user. [CWS]

Version 0.3b
  * Moved !command and %eval into an extension, and fixed a !cmd bug.  [DPN]
  * Fixed the unknown-command-sent-to-server bug.  [DPN]
  * Fixed the slow-more-update bug.  [DPN]
  * Zone extension: fixed the negative-time bug.  [DPN]
  * Minor UI bugfix involving the input line's attributes.  [DPN]
  * The Build script will now cache whether the directories in the cache
    file are for the local directory, and warn you not to do an install. [CWS]
  * If you try to install while your cached directories are for the local
    directory, the Build script asks you if you really want to install. [CWS]
  * The Build script explains better about the module library directory
    (that you shouldn't add the trailing /LC) when asking for it. [CWS]

Version 0.3a
  * Build script now asks what paths you want to use and caches them,
    rather than making you edit Build.PL to set them.
  * Build script makes all generated files read-only to discourage editing.
  * perl Build.PL release now works.
  * Sendgroup expansion (=) now works.
  * Extensions may be loaded and unloaded during a lily session.
  * Timezone rewriting works again, through the 'zone' extension.
  * Groups are supported (the expander knows about them).
  * -- MORE -- works.
  * The password does not appear in the command history.
  * Command handlers' arguments' no longer have trailing whitespace.  (As of
    0.2c, they were receiving a terminating \n, which made just about every
    command handler break.)

Version 0.2c
  * Fixed a bug which made 0.2b unable to run.

Version 0.2b
  * Redesigned the event model.
  * Began documenting; Event.pm and State.pm have manpages.
  * Added a README and ChangeLog.
  * Loadable extensions, thanks to Josh.
  * Build script, thanks to Albert.

Version 0.2a
  * /info edit 
  * complete redesign of parsing engine and event handling. 
  * here/away status on status line. 

Version 0.1f

  * tab completion 

Version 0.1e
  * Help now mentions -zonedelta option. 
  * A few more server messages are recognized, thanks to Silent Bob. 
  * Network input routines are rewritten. 
  * A truly obscure bug involving printing the sequence '\<' is now fixed. 
  * Gagging is implemented: %gag <user> 
  * Perl code now requires %eval <code>, instead of just %code. 


Version 0.1d
  * password no longer echos. 
  * user-entered text now has an attribute 
  * timezone rewriting added 


Version 0.1c
  * Silly me. I made a foolish error when merging Josh's info patch. Fixed. 
  * /info set now works for discussions. Really. 


Version 0.1b
  * /info set now works for discussions. 
  * Private messages to multiple destinations are parsed correctly. 
  * C-d deletes the character following the cursor. 
  * Turning your blurb off is noticed. 
  * C-w deletes the word preceding the cursor. 
  * The status line is drawn in reverse when in mono mode. 
  * C-u now repositions the cursor properly. 
  * Internal handling of control characters is cleaner. 
  * Backslashes are no longer invisible.

Version 0.1a
  * It has many, many bugs. Tell us about them.
